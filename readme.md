# Extra Features
	
> Zombie Spawner

the Game will continuously spawn new zombies for you to attack which is a way to get point for the users. There are rough 40 Zombies to target from the start of the game and does not go higher than that 

> Animated Sky 

Since this is a game about using a drone and a flying device it made sense to add clouds and displacement filter to make the game more lively than a drone just flying around from block to block  

# What tech did I use ? 
I made use of **PIXI.js** to render the sprites , **GIMP** and **inkscape** to make the sprites and **spritesheets**. **Webpack** to bundle my javascript and **docker** to dockerise the application for deployment
